# Poor Man's Nitro
A bot to replace Nitro


Install node or higher, install the dependancies you see in the require() function at the top
Install PM2 on node `npm install pm2` or something

Add your bot token to the bottom of the file, and run with PM2:

`pm2 start test.js`

while in the directory. Bot should be online, then add bot to your server by generating the link with the discord permissions calculator. 


Pretty simple.
